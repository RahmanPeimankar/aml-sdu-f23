# Please Follow the Instruction Below to Run the Notebooks

On this page, you can find course materials such as slides and Jupyter notebooks.

You only need to launch *Binder* by clicking on the above logo. This will basically setup the environment that you need to run the Jupyter notebooks on the cloud. This may take **a few minutes**. So, grab a cup of coffee ðŸ˜Š. 

Alternatively, you may open the notebooks for each lecture in Colab!
